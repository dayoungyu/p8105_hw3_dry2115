Problem 1
---------

Read and clean brfss\_smart2010 data:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)

brfss_df = as.tibble(
  brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(state = locationabbr, county = locationdesc) %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  arrange(response)
)
```

Find states that were observed at 7 locations:

``` r
seven_locations = brfss_df %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(n_locations = n_distinct(county)) %>%
  filter(n_locations == 7)
```

Connecticut, Florida, and North Carolina were observed at 7 locations.

Spaghetti plot that shows the number of locations at each state from 2002 to 2010:

``` r
n_locations = (brfss_df %>%
  filter(year %in% (2002:2010)) %>%
  group_by(state, year) %>%
  summarize(n_locations = n_distinct(county)))

ggplot(n_locations, aes(x = year, y = n_locations)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, aes(color = state)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Distinct Locations by State in 2002-2010",
    x = "Year",
    y = "N distinct locations"
  )
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'
